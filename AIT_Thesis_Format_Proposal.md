## ABSTRACT

This project proposes a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict national life expectancy using multi-source datasets including World Bank Development Indicators, UNDP Human Development Reports, and World Happiness Reports. The study addresses critical methodological challenges including temporal data leakage prevention and class imbalance handling while identifying key socioeconomic, health, and governance drivers of life expectancy. Our approach integrates 217 countries' data spanning 1960-2024, employing advanced feature engineering and ensemble modeling techniques. Preliminary analysis reveals strong correlations between GDP per capita (r=0.75), infant mortality (r=-0.85), and life expectancy, establishing a robust foundation for predictive modeling. The project aims to achieve superior performance (RMSE <3.5 years, R²>0.85) compared to existing baseline models while providing actionable insights for policy makers and international development organizations.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Life expectancy serves as a fundamental barometer of national health, development, and societal well-being. It encapsulates the complex interplay between healthcare systems, economic prosperity, environmental conditions, social structures, and governance quality. Over the past century, global life expectancy has increased dramatically from approximately 32 years in 1900 to over 72 years today, yet significant disparities persist both between and within countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of health systems and the importance of understanding factors that contribute to population resilience. Countries with robust healthcare infrastructure, strong social support systems, and effective governance demonstrated better outcomes during the crisis. This underscores the critical need for predictive models that can identify vulnerable populations and guide evidence-based policy interventions.

### 1.2 Business Understanding

The ability to accurately predict and understand life expectancy drivers has profound implications across multiple sectors:

**Government and Policy Making:**
- Resource allocation for healthcare infrastructure and social services
- Long-term planning for pension systems and social security
- Evidence-based policy development for health promotion
- International development priority setting

**Insurance and Financial Services:**
- Life insurance premium calculation and risk assessment
- Pension fund management and actuarial modeling
- Healthcare cost projections and planning

**International Development:**
- Aid allocation and program effectiveness evaluation
- Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring and reporting
- Identification of countries requiring urgent intervention

**Healthcare Organizations:**
- Strategic planning for service delivery and capacity building
- Population health management and preventive care strategies
- Resource optimization and efficiency improvements

### 1.3 Potential Impact

This research will contribute to:
- **Enhanced Policy Effectiveness**: Data-driven insights enabling more targeted and effective health interventions
- **Improved Resource Allocation**: Better understanding of factors with highest impact on population health outcomes
- **Early Warning Systems**: Identification of countries at risk of declining life expectancy trends
- **Academic Contribution**: Novel integration of happiness and social indicators with traditional health metrics
- **Practical Applications**: Actionable recommendations for governments, NGOs, and international organizations

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 Primary Objective

**To develop a robust machine learning pipeline that accurately predicts national life expectancy while identifying the most significant socioeconomic, health, environmental, and governance factors that influence population longevity.**

### 2.2 Specific Research Questions

1. **Predictive Accuracy**: Can we achieve superior prediction performance (RMSE <3.5 years) compared to existing baseline models using multi-source data integration?

2. **Feature Importance**: Which factors among economic indicators (GDP, health expenditure), social metrics (happiness, social support), environmental conditions (PM2.5 pollution), and governance measures (corruption perception) most strongly predict life expectancy?

3. **Temporal Patterns**: How do the relationships between predictors and life expectancy evolve over time, and can temporal modeling improve prediction accuracy?

4. **Regional Variations**: Do the key drivers of life expectancy vary significantly across different geographic regions and income levels?

## 3. RELATED WORKS

### 3.1 Foundational Research

**Preston Curve and Economic Determinants:**
The seminal work by Preston (1975) established the fundamental relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, demonstrating a logarithmic association that has been consistently validated across countries and time periods. Subsequent research by Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006) expanded this framework to include education, healthcare access, and technological advancement as key mediating factors.

**Social Determinants of Health:**
The WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health (Marmot et al., 2008) provided comprehensive evidence that social conditions significantly impact health outcomes. Studies by Avendano and Kawachi (2014) and Harper (2021) have demonstrated how income inequality, social cohesion, and governance quality influence population health beyond individual-level factors.

**Environmental Health Impact:**
Research by Pope et al. (2009) and subsequent studies have established clear links between environmental factors, particularly air pollution (PM2.5), and mortality rates. These findings highlight the importance of including environmental indicators in comprehensive life expectancy models.

### 3.2 Machine Learning Applications

**Traditional Approaches:**
Early predictive models relied primarily on linear regression and demographic life tables. While interpretable, these approaches often failed to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between multiple factors.

**Advanced ML Techniques:**
Recent studies have employed ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and neural networks to improve prediction accuracy. However, most existing work focuses on single-source datasets and fails to address temporal dependencies properly.

**Limitations of Current Approaches:**
- Limited integration of multi-source datasets
- Inadequate handling of temporal dependencies and data leakage
- Insufficient attention to model interpretability and policy relevance
- Lack of comprehensive evaluation across different geographic regions

### 3.3 Research Gaps

Our study addresses several critical gaps in existing literature:
1. **Multi-source Integration**: First comprehensive study combining World Bank, UNDP, and Happiness Report data
2. **Temporal Modeling**: Proper handling of time-series dependencies with lag features and temporal validation
3. **Methodological Rigor**: Systematic approach to data leakage prevention and class imbalance handling
4. **Policy Focus**: Emphasis on actionable insights for evidence-based decision making
