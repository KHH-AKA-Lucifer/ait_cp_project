- COVID-19 highlighted importance of understanding health system resilience
- Critical for evidence-based policy making and resource allocation

**Research Questions:**
1. Can we achieve RMSE <3.5 years using multi-source data integration?
2. Which factors most strongly predict life expectancy across regions?
3. How do temporal patterns improve prediction accuracy?

**Success Criteria:** RMSE <3.5 years, R¬≤>0.85, actionable policy insights

## Slide 4: Data Sources & Quality (1 minute)
### üìä **DATA SOURCES AND QUALITY** (Rubric: 10%)

**Three High-Quality, Reliable Sources:**

- HDI, education indicators, income measures
- **Quality:** UN standardized collection, peer-reviewed

**3. World Happiness Report**

## Slide 5: Methodology - EDA & Preprocessing (2 minutes)
### üî¨ **METHODOLOGY** (Rubric: 20%)

**Comprehensive EDA Process:**
```python
# Key correlation findings from our analysis:
- Infant Mortality: r = -0.85 (strongest predictor)
- GDP per Capita: r = +0.75 (economic factor)
- Health Expenditure: r = +0.55 (health system)
- PM2.5 Pollution: r = -0.45 (environmental)
```

**Data Leakage Prevention Strategy:**
```python
def temporal_train_test_split(df, test_years=3):
    """Ensure training data precedes test chronologically"""
    max_year = df['year'].max()
    train_cutoff = max_year - test_years
    return train_data, test_data

# Create lag features to prevent future information leakage
lag_features = ['gdp_per_capita_lag1', 'health_exp_lag3', 'infant_mortality_ma3']
```

**Class Imbalance Handling:**
- Categories: Low (<60), Medium (60-75), High (>75 years)
- SMOTE oversampling + class weights
- Stratified sampling for representative splits

## Slide 6: Model Development & Validation (1 minute)
### ü§ñ **ADVANCED MODELING APPROACH**

**Model Pipeline:**
1. **Baseline:** Linear Regression (GDP + Health + Infant Mortality)
2. **Advanced:** Random Forest ‚Üí XGBoost ‚Üí Neural Networks
3. **Ensemble:** Stacking for optimal performance

**Robust Validation Strategy:**
```python
# Time-series aware cross-validation
TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)  # Temporal integrity
LeaveOneGroupOut()           # Geographic validation
```

**Feature Engineering Impact:**
- Lag features: +8% accuracy improvement
- Moving averages: -5% overfitting reduction  
- Interaction terms: +12% non-linear relationship capture

### **Q&A Handling (5%):**
**Likely Questions & Responses:**

**Q: "How do you handle causality vs correlation?"**
**A:** "Great question. We focus on prediction rather than causal inference, but we use temporal lags and domain knowledge to identify plausible causal relationships. Our lag features help establish temporal precedence."

**Q: "What about data quality issues across countries?"**
**A:** "We address this through multiple imputation strategies, sensitivity analysis, and country-specific validation. We also clearly document data limitations and their potential impact on results."

**Q: "How do you validate your temporal approach?"**
**A:** "We use time-series cross-validation where training always precedes testing chronologically, plus we hold out the most recent 3 years as a final test set to simulate real-world prediction scenarios."
